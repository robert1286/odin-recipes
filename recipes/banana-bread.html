        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 tbs butter</li>

        <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>optional- 1/2 cup of chocolate chips or nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use non-stcik spray on pan. Line pan with parchment paper for easier removal. Have 8 tables spoons (1 stick) of butter melted and cooled
         Have 2 bowls ready: one for dry ingrediants and one for wet ingrediants, mash the ripe bananas</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>In the first bowl combine butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and eggs. you may now add the mashed bananas after everythings combined if u want to leave them more chunky.

        </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            In the second bowl combine the rest of the dry ingrediants: salt, flour, baking soda, cinnamon

        </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
            Slowly pour and stir in the dry ingrediants bowl into the first (wet ingrediants) bowl. Carful not to add to quickly in order to avoid air pockets.
        </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <P>
            Pour finished batter into pan. You may add nuts/ chocolate chips if you wish. (add a pinch of flour to chips to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the batter)
            Very lighty coat the surface of the batter with granulated sugar (this is the caremalized crust!). Do not over coat as if will simply not be caremalized on top of the bread.
        </P>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p> 
            place pan into oven for 50 minutes. To check if ready, use knife in center of bread, if it comes out clean then you're set!
